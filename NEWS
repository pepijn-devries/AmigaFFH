AmigaFFH v0.2.0 (Release date: 2019-01-27)
=============

 * Added support for Amiga Workbench Icons (*.info)

 * Added support for the Amiga's system-configuration file

 * Added rasterToHWSprite function

 * Changed 'as.raster' from S4 method to S3 function
   for more flexibility.

 * 'rasterToBitmap' did not decode continuous bitmaps
   correctly. This has been fixed. Fortunately the Amiga
   mostly uses interleaved bitmaps anyway.

 * Added constrains to error distribution in dither method
   of 'index.colours'. Without these constrains errors could
   accumulate for certain images and cause undesirable results.

 * Fixed transparency detection in 'index.colour' function

 * Bug-fix in the interpretation of IFF ANIM frames

 * Moved ProTrackR and adfExplorer from 'Depends' to 'Suggests'
   to avoid circular dependancy

 * Several minor corrections to the manual
