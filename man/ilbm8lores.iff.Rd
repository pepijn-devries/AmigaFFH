\title{An example file of a bitmap image stored in the Interchange File Format}
\format{
See \code{\link{IFFChunk-class}} and references for more information
about the Interchange File Format.
}
\description{
This file is provided to demonstrate the structure of an Interchange File
Format and is used in several examples throughout this package.
}
\details{
The Interchange File Format stores information compartmentally in separate
containers called `chunks'. This file demonstrates how a bitmap image
is stored in this format. In addition to the raw bitmap data, the file
also contains meta-information on the bitmap dimensions, its colour palette and
the display mode that should be used on an Amiga. See also
\code{\link{interpretIFFChunk}}, \code{\link{IFFChunk-class}}
and the example for \code{\link{bitmapToRaster}}.
